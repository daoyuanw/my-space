When I was creating my website, I learnt my very first programming language: [Markdown](https://markdown.com.cn/intro.html#markdown-%E6%98%AF%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%EF%BC%9F). 
The link above is an official guidance for markdown, though I haven't read it completely because I solely focused on the questions I 've met. In fact, most of my knowledge learned from [the blog of Hongtao Hao](https://intro2code.hongtaoh.com/markdown#md-grammer) who was a student majored in journalism and communication then trasfered to computer science. It means that he knew beginners well so that he wrote the tutorial document in extreme detail.

Except for the basic grammer, I would like to share the solutions of the problems I've met here.
